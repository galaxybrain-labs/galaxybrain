# Structure Run Tool

The [StructureRunTool](../../reference/griptape/tools/structure_run/tool.md) Tool provides a way to run Structures via a Tool.
It requires you to provide a [Structure Run Driver](../../griptape-framework/drivers/structure-run-drivers.md) to run the Structure in the desired environment.
