# Inpainting Image Generation Tool

This tool allows LLMs to generate images using inpainting, where an input image is altered within the area specified by a mask image according to a prompt. The input and mask images can be provided either by their file path or by their [Task Memory](../../griptape-framework/structures/task-memory.md) references.

```python

```
