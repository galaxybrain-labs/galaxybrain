                             Response: The text provides detailed instructions for building and installing Neovim from source on various operating systems, including Linux,
                             BSD, Windows, and macOS. Key points include:

                             1. **Pre-requisites**: Ensure all build dependencies are installed.
                             2. **Cloning and Building**:
                                - Clone the Neovim repository.
                                - Use `make` with appropriate `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` (Release, Debug, RelWithDebInfo).
                                - For stable releases, checkout the stable branch.
                                - Use `gmake` on BSD and follow specific instructions for Windows using MSVC.
                             3. **Installation**:
                                - Default install location is `/usr/local`.
                                - On Debian/Ubuntu, build a DEB package for clean installation.
                                - Custom install locations can be set using `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
                             4. **Dependencies**:
                                - Third-party dependencies are automatically downloaded.
                                - Use `Ninja` and `ccache` for faster builds.
                             5. **Platform-Specific Instructions**:
                                - Detailed steps for building on Windows using Visual Studio.
                                - Instructions for building on macOS using Homebrew or MacPorts.
                                - Specific commands for building on NixOS, Cygwin, and MSYS2.
                             6. **Debugging and Development**:
                                - Use `RelWithDebInfo` for optimized builds with debug info.
                                - Instructions for using debuggers and handling build cache.
                             7. **Localization**:
                                - Commands for checking and updating translations.

                             Output: To build Neovim from source on macOS, follow these steps:

                             1. **Install Dependencies**:
                                Ensure you have the necessary build dependencies installed. You can use Homebrew to install them:
                                ```sh
                                brew install ninja libtool automake cmake pkg-config gettext curl
                                ```

                             2. **Clone the Neovim Repository**:
                                Clone the Neovim repository from GitHub:
                                ```sh
                                git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git
                                cd neovim
                                ```

                             3. **Checkout the Stable Branch (Optional)**:
                                If you want to build the stable release, checkout the stable branch:
                                ```sh
                                git checkout stable
                                ```

                             4. **Build Neovim**:
                                Use `make` to build Neovim. You can specify the build type (Release, Debug, RelWithDebInfo):
                                ```sh
                                make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
                                ```

                             5. **Install Neovim**:
                                After building, install Neovim. The default install location is `/usr/local`:
                                ```sh
                                sudo make install
                                ```

                             By following these steps, you should be able to build and install Neovim from source on macOS. For more detailed instructions and
                             troubleshooting tips, refer to the [BUILD.md](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/BUILD.md) file in the Neovim repository.
