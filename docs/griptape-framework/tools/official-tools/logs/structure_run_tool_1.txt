                             Response: Modular RAG (Retrieval-Augmented         
                             Generation) is an approach in natural language     
                             processing that combines retrieval-based methods   
                             with generative models to improve the quality and  
                             relevance of generated text. The modular aspect    
                             refers to the flexibility in integrating different 
                             components or modules, such as retrieval systems   
                             and generative models, to create a more robust and 
                             adaptable system.                                  
                                                                                
                             In a typical RAG setup, a retrieval module first   
                             searches a large corpus of documents to find       
                             relevant information based on a given query. This  
                             retrieved information is then used by a generative 
                             model to produce a coherent and contextually       
                             relevant response or output. The modularity allows 
                             for the swapping or upgrading of individual        
                             components, such as using different retrieval      
                             algorithms or generative models, to optimize       
                             performance for specific tasks or datasets. This   
                             approach leverages the strengths of both retrieval 
                             and generation, aiming to produce more accurate and
                             informative results.
