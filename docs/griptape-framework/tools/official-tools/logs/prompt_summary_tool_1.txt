                             follow these general steps:                        
                                                                                
                             1. **Check for Breaking Changes**: Before          
                             upgrading, review any breaking changes that might  
                             affect your setup.

                             Neovim repository to your local machine.           
                                                                                
                             4. **Build Neovim**:                               
                                - Use CMake to configure the build environment. 
                                - Use Ninja to compile the source code.         
                                                                                
                             5. **Install Neovim**: After building, install     
                             Neovim using the appropriate command for your      
                             system.
