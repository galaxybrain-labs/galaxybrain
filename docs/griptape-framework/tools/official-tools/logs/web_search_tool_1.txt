                             Output: Photosynthesis is the process by which     
                             green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert     
                             light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical  
                             energy stored in glucose. This process is essential
                             for the survival of life on Earth as it provides   
                             the primary energy source for nearly all organisms.
                             Here's how it works:                               
                                                                                
                             1. **Light Absorption**: Chlorophyll, the green    
                             pigment in plant cells, absorbs sunlight. This     
                             energy is used to excite electrons, which are then 
                             transferred through a series of proteins embedded  
                             in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts.     
                                                                                
                             2. **Water Splitting**: The absorbed light energy  
                             is used to split water molecules (H₂O) into oxygen,
                             protons, and electrons. This process releases      
                             oxygen as a byproduct, which is expelled into the  
                             atmosphere.                                        
                                                                                
                             3. **Electron Transport Chain**: The excited       
                             electrons move through the electron transport      
                             chain, a series of proteins in the thylakoid       
                             membrane. As they move, they release energy, which 
                             is used to pump protons into the thylakoid lumen,  
                             creating a proton gradient.                        
                                                                                
                             4. **ATP and NADPH Formation**: The energy from the
                             proton gradient is used by ATP synthase to convert 
                             ADP and inorganic phosphate into ATP. Meanwhile,   
                             the electrons reduce NADP⁺ to NADPH. Both ATP and  
                             NADPH are energy carriers used in the next stage of
                             photosynthesis.                                    
                                                                                
                             5. **Calvin Cycle (Carbon Fixation)**: In the      
                             stroma of the chloroplast, ATP and NADPH produced  
                             in the light-dependent reactions are used to       
                             convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere   
                             into glucose. This process involves a series of    
                             reactions known as the Calvin Cycle, where CO₂ is  
                             fixed into a stable intermediate and eventually    
                             converted into glucose.                            
                                                                                
                             6. **Glucose Utilization**: The glucose produced   
                             can be used immediately by the plant for energy or 
                             can be stored as starch for later use. It also     
                             serves as the starting material for other organic  
                             compounds needed by the plant.                     
                                                                                
                             Overall, photosynthesis converts solar energy into 
                             chemical energy, providing food and oxygen, which  
                             are vital for the survival of most life forms on   
                             Earth.
