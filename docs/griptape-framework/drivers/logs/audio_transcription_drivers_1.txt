                             Response: The birch canoe slid on the smooth       
                             planks. Glued the sheet to the dark blue           
                             background. It is easy to tell the depth of a well.
                             These days a chicken leg is a rare dish. Rice is   
                             often served in round bowls. The juice of lemons   
                             makes fine punch. The box was thrown beside the    
                             park truck. The hogs were fed chopped corn and     
                             garbage. Four hours of steady work faced us. A     
                             large size in stockings is hard to sell.
