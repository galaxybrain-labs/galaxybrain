                             Input: I need to solve the equation `3x + 11 = 14`.
                             Can you help me?                                   
Certainly! To solve the equation \(3x + 11 = 14\), follow these steps:

1. **Subtract 11 from both sides**:
   \[
   3x + 11 - 11 = 14 - 11
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   3x = 3
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3**:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{3}{3}
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   x = 1
   \]

Thus, the solution to the equation \(3x + 11 = 14\) is \(x = 1\).[02/13/25 21:34:15] INFO     AssistantTask d9917bbd81944855a647e7425dd640af
