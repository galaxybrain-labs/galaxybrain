**The Tapestry of Time**

Beneath the sky, so vast, so wide,  
Where whispers of the winds reside,  
A tale unfolds, both old and new,  
Of fleeting moments, and skies of blue.  

The rivers carve their ancient song,  
Through valleys deep, they rush along,  
Their waters speak of years gone by,  
Of laughter, tears, and questions: why?  

The mountains stand, both proud and tall,  
Witness to the rise and fall,  
Of empires built, of dreams once sown,  
Of seeds forgotten, yet still grown.  

The stars above, eternal flames,  
Have watched us play our fleeting games,  
They blink and shimmer, cold yet kind,  
A mirror to the human mind.  

For time, it weaves a tapestry,  
Of love, of loss, of mystery,  
Each thread a life, each stitch a day,  
Each color bright, or washed to gray.  

The child laughs, the elder sighs,  
The sun will set, the moon will rise,  
And in between, we live, we learn,  
We build, we break, we heal, we yearn.  

The poet writes, the painter dreams,  
The thinker questions what it means,  
The farmer tills, the sailor sails,  
The prisoner waits, the hero prevails.  

Yet all are bound by time's embrace,  
Its gentle hand, its hurried pace,  
It gives us moments, takes them too,  
A fleeting gift, both old and new.  

Oh, fleeting time, you cruel, kind thief,  
You bring us joy, you bring us grief,  
You teach us love, you teach us pain,  
You give, you take, you come again.  

But in your flow, we find our place,  
A fleeting spark in endless space,  
A chance to love, to laugh, to cry,  
To live, to dream, to question why.  

So let us dance, while we are here,  
Embrace the now, the far, the near,  
For though the stars may watch and wait,  
Our time is ours to celebrate.  

The rivers flow, the mountains stand,  
The stars still shine, so cold, so grand,  
And we, like threads, will intertwine,  
In the endless tapestry of time.
