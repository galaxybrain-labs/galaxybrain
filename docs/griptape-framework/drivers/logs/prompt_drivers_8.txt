                             Output: Imagine a computer like a super smart      
                             friend who can help you do lots of things.         
                                                                                
                             Inside the computer, there's a special part called 
                             the "brain" or "processor." It's like the boss who 
                             tells the computer what to do.                     
                                                                                
                             The computer also has a "memory" like your brain.  
                             It stores all the information you give it, like    
                             your favorite games and videos.                    
                                                                                
                             When you type or click on something, the computer  
                             sends a message to the brain. The brain then tells 
                             the computer what to do, like open a game or show  
                             you a picture.                                     
                                                                                
                             The computer has a "screen" like a TV. It shows you
                             what the computer is doing, like the game you're   
                             playing or the website you're visiting.            
                                                                                
                             And finally, the computer has a "keyboard" and     
                             "mouse" that you use to talk to it. You can type   
                             words or move the mouse to tell the computer what  
                             you want it to do.                                 
                                                                                
                             So, the computer is like a super smart friend who  
                             helps you do things by using its brain, memory,    
                             screen, keyboard, and mouse.
