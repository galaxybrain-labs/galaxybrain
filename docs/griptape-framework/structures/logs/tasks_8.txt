                             Input: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of 
                             computer science that deals with creating machines 
                             capable of thinking and learning. It encompasses   
                             various fields such as machine learning, neural    
                             networks, and deep learning. AI has the potential  
                             to revolutionize many sectors, including           
                             healthcare, finance, and transportation. Our life  
                             in this modern age depends largely on computers. It
                             is almost impossible to think about life without   
                             computers. We need computers in everything that we 
                             use in our daily lives. So it becomes very         
                             important to make computers intelligent so that our
                             lives become easy. Artificial Intelligence is the  
                             theory and development of computers, which imitates
                             the human intelligence and senses, such as visual  
                             perception, speech recognition, decision-making,   
                             and translation between languages. Artificial      
                             Intelligence has brought a revolution in the world 
                             of technology.
