                             that suggests that extraterrestrial civilizations  
                             are deliberately keeping silent and avoiding       
                             detection due to the potential threat posed by     
                             other civilizations. It is based on the idea that  
                             the universe is like a dark forest where every     
                             civilization is a hunter, and revealing one's      
                             presence could lead to being hunted and destroyed. 
                             This hypothesis is used to explain the Fermi       
                             Paradox, which questions why we have not yet       
                             detected signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life
                             despite the vastness of the universe.
