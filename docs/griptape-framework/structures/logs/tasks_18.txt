                             Output: Fill the ink jar with sticky glue. He      
                             smoked a big pipe with strong contents. We need    
                             grain to keep our mules healthy. Pack the records  
                             in a neat thin case. The crunch of feet in the snow
                             was the only sound. The copper bowl shone in the   
                             sun's rays. Boards will warp unless kept dry. The  
                             plush chair leaned against the wall. Glass will    
                             clink when struck by metal. Bathe and relax in the 
                             cool green grass.
