Griptape is a platform designed to help developers build, deploy, and scale end-to-end solutions, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs). It offers tools for data preparation, retrieval, AI agents, pipelines, and workflows. Griptape provides an open-source AI framework and an execution runtime called Griptape AI Cloud.

Key features include:

- **Build & Secure**: Developers can use predictable, programmable Python to build business logic, turning any developer into an AI developer. The platform emphasizes security, performance, and cost efficiency with its Off-Promptâ„¢ feature.

- **Deploy & Scale**: Griptape allows for the deployment and running of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and other structures without the need for infrastructure management. It offers simple API abstractions and seamless scaling.

- **Manage & Monitor**: Users can monitor performance, reliability, and spending directly in Griptape Cloud or integrate with third-party services. It also allows for policy enforcement across users, structures, tasks, and queries.

Griptape AI Framework provides abstractions for building Gen AI Agents, Systems of Agents, Pipelines, Workflows, and RAG implementations without requiring extensive knowledge of Gen AI or Prompt Engineering.

Griptape AI Cloud handles infrastructure management, hosting everything from data processing pipelines to serverless application runtimes. It supports automated data preparation, retrieval as a service, and structure runtime for building AI agents, pipelines, and workflows.
