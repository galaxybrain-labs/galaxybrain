                             Output: In the hush of dawn's embrace,             
                             Where shadows dance with light,                    
                             The world awakens softly,                          
                             From the tender arms of night.                     
                                                                                
                             The sky, a canvas painted,                         
                             With hues of gold and blue,                        
                             Whispers tales of morning,                         
                             In colors bold and true.                           
                                                                                
                             The trees sway gently, singing,                    
                             A melody of grace,                                 
                             Leaves rustle in the chorus,                       
                             Nature's gentle pace.                              
                                                                                
                             The river flows with purpose,                      
                             A silver ribbon's gleam,                           
                             Carrying dreams and secrets,                       
                             In its endless, flowing stream.                    
                                                                                
                             The flowers bloom in splendor,                     
                             Their petals kissed by dew,                        
                             A symphony of fragrance,                           
                             In every shade and hue.                            
                                                                                
                             In this serene awakening,                          
                             The world finds its refrain,                       
                             A poem of life unfolding,                          
                             In nature's sweet domain.                          
                                                                                
                             So let us pause and listen,                        
                             To the morning's gentle song,                      
                             For in its quiet beauty,                           
                             Our hearts and souls belong.
